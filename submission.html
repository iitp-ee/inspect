                    <p>
                        Prospective authors are encouraged to submit full papers in PDF format not exceeding 6 pages in
                        double-column includes all figures, tables, and references, per page (maximum 2 extra page). The
                        paper must follow the standard IEEE template <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" translate="_blank">Link here</a> .
                        Papers not compliant with the IEEE template
                        including appropriate referencing or exceeding the page limit will be returned without review. Only original
                        papers that have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere will be considered. The paper
                        must clearly indicate the research area, main results, and contributions. <b>
                            All Accepted and Presented
                            papers
                            will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore, which is indexed with world's leading Abstracting &
                            Indexing (A&I) databases (SCOPUS etc.)
                        </b>

                    <p>
                        Submission of a scientific paper is considered a commitment that, upon acceptance, authors will submit their
                        camera-ready version for inclusion in the formal proceedings and will present the paper at the conference.
                        Each accepted contribution must have at least one paid registration by the time the camera-ready paper is
                        submitted for inclusion in the proceedings. INSPECT reserves the right to remove from IEEE Xplore papers and
                        posters not presented at the symposium.

                        Accepted papers will be assigned to a regular technical session. All papers will go through a rigorous,
                        single-blind reviewing process. At least one author of an accepted paper will have to register at the
                        conference in order to submit the final version. All accepted papers presented at the conference will be
                        published in the conference proceeding and submitted to IEEE Xplore for publication subject to their norms.
                        They should satisfy the requirements given in the publication policy.

                    <h4 class="subTitle">IEEE Policies</h4>
                    <p>
                        IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., by not including
                        it in IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference. Papers are reviewed on the basis that
                        they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same
                        time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and IEEE will take action against any
                        author who has engaged in either practice.
                    </p>

                            before the final publication. The listed comments should be addressed carefully in your revision; it is
                            mandatory for all authors to incorporate all the changes suggested by reviewers and adhere to IEEE
                            conditions, else their paper will be excluded from conference proceedings.

                            plagiarism (more than 30%) after registration without refund.
